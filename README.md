# WAF - Getting started with WAF, Bot Detection and Threat Campaigns

This class will focus on a best practice approach to getting started with F5 WAF and application security. This introductory class will give you guidance on deploying WAF services in a successive fashion. This 141 class focuses entirely on the negative security model aspects of WAF configuration.
This is the 1st class in a three part lab series (141,241,341) based on: [Succeeding with Application Security](https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K07359270) which closely maps to this visualization of layered Application Security.
